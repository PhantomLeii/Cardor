I started self-studying some computer science with materials and resources gathered by a community known as the (Open Source Society University (OSSU))[https://ossu.dev/]. They've compiled something really comprehensive, do have a look at what they have to offer. The project demonstrated here is an idea I got from the CS50x course hosted by (Harvard University)[https://harvard/] among all the courses and learning resources gathered by the fore mentioned body.
